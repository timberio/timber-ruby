## [Unreleased]
### Changed

  - Omniauth integration was removed since it only captures user context during the Authentication
    phase. Omniauth does not persist sessions. As such, the integration is extremely low value
    and could cause unintended issues.

## [2.2.0] - 2017-09-13
### Changed

  - The default HTTP log device queue type was switched to a
    `Timber::LogDevices::HTTP::FlushableDroppingSizedQueue` instead of a `::SizedQueue`. In the
    event of extremely high volume logging, and delivery cannot keep up, Timber will drop messages
    instead of applying back pressure.
