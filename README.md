## What is Timber?

Timber automatically structures your logs with events and context in a non-proprietary JSON format.
It’s simple, quick, managed, and has absolutely no risk of code debt or lock-in.
It’s just good ol’ logging.

Timber’s philosophy is that application insight should be open and owned by you. It should not
require a myriad of services to accomplish. And there is no better, or more complete, vehicle
than logging to solve this:

1. It’s a shared practice that has been around since the dawn of computers.
2. It’s baked into every language, library, and framework. Even your own apps.
3. The data is open and entirely owned by you. Yay!
4. [The truth is the log](http://files.timber.io/images/log-is-the-truth.png) :)

The problem is that logs are unstructured, noisy, and hard to use. Timber solves this by being
application aware, properly structuring your logs, and optionally providing a [fast, modern,
and beautiful console](https://timber.io) -- allowing you to easily, and sanely, realize the
power of your logs.


## How does it work?

Glad you asked! :) Timber automatically structures your logs by taking advantage of public APIs.

For example, by subscribing to `ActiveSupport::Notifications`, Timber can automatically turn this:

```
Completed 200 OK in 117ms (Views: 85.2ms | ActiveRecord: 25.3ms)
```

Into this:

```json
{
  "dt": "2016-12-01T02:23:12.236543Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Completed 200 OK in 117ms (Views: 85.2ms | ActiveRecord: 25.3ms)",
  "context": {
    "http": {
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/checkout",
      "remote_addr": "123.456.789.10",
      "request_id": "abcd1234"
    },
    "user": {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Ben Johnson",
      "email": "ben@johnson.com"
    }
  },
  "event": {
    "http_response": {
      "status": 200,
      "time_ms": 117
    }
  }
}
```

It does the same for `http requests`, `sql queries`, `exceptions`, `template renderings`,
and any other event your framework logs. (for a full list see `Timber::Events`)


## Logging Custom Events

> Another service? More code debt? :*(

Nope! Logging custom events is Just Logging™. Check it out:

```ruby
# Simple string (original Logger interface remains untouched)
Logger.warn "Payment rejected for customer abcd1234, reason: Card expired"

# Structured hash
Logger.warn message: "Payment rejected", type: :payment_rejected,
  data: %{customer_id: "abcd1234", amount: 100, reason: "Card expired"}

# Using a Struct
PaymentRejectedEvent = Struct.new(:customer_id, :amount, :reason) do
  def message; "Payment rejected for #{customer_id}"; end
  def type; :payment_rejected; end
end
Logger.warn PaymentRejectedEvent.new("abcd1234", 100, "Card expired")
```

(for more examples, see the `Timber::Logger` docs)

No mention of Timber anywhere! In fact, this approach pushes things the opposite way. What if,
as a result of structured logging, you could start decoupling other services from your application?

Before:

```
               |---[HTTP]---> sentry / bugsnag / etc
My Application |---[HTTP]---> librato / graphite / etc
               |---[HTTP]---> new relic / etc
               |--[STDOUT]--> logs
                                |---> Logging service
                                |---> S3
                                |---> RedShift
```


After:

```
                                                    |-- sentry / bugsnag / etc
                                                    |-- librato / graphite / etc
My Application |--[STDOUT]--> logs ---> Timber ---> |-- new relic / etc
                               ^                    |-- S3
                               |                    |-- RedShift
                               |                                 ^
                    fast, efficient, durable,                    |
                     replayable, auditable,        change any of these without
                          just logging                  touching your code
                                                       *and* backfill them!
```

## The Timber Console / Pricing

> This is all gravy, but wouldn't the extra data get expensive?

If you opt use the [Timber Console](https://timber.io), we only charge for
the size of the `message`, `dt`, and `event.custom` attributes. Everything else is
stored at no cost to you. [Say wha?!](http://i.giphy.com/l0HlL2vlfpWI0meJi.gif). This ensures
pricing remains predictable. We charge per GB sent to us and retained. No user limits,
no weird feature matrixes, just data. Finally, the data is yours, in a simple
non-proprietary JSON format that you can export to S3, Redshift, or any of our other integrations.

For more details checkout out [timber.io](https://timber.io).

## Install

### 1. Install the gem:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'timber'
```

### 2. Install the logger:

#### Heroku:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb (or staging, etc)
config.logger = Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT)
```

The command to add your log drain will be displayed in the [Timber app](https://app.timber.io)
after you add your application.

#### Non-Heroku:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb (or staging, etc)
log_device = Timber::LogDevices::HTTP.new(ENV['TIMBER_KEY']) # key can be obtained by signing up at https://timber.io
config.logger = Timber::Logger.new(log_device)
```

Your Timber application key will be displayed in the [Timber app](https://app.timber.io)
after you add your application.


*Other transport methods coming soon!*
