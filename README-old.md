## What is Timber?

Timber is an all-encompassing logging solution built specifically for applications.
No complicated interfaces, parsing rules, or setup. Just simple, highly tuned ruby
logging that actually saves you time and makes you more productive.

## How is Timber different?

Timber was built specifically for application developers, not sys-ops engineers.
It's focused, and it knows about your application and all of the event it generates.
This means Timber can make assumptions and polish the experience in ways other's can't.
This translates into a simple,

polish the experience in ways other's cant.

Timber was built specifically for applications with a focus on making your logs highly useful
with as little setup as possible.



Timber's fundamental difference is that it structures your
logs from within your application, instead of being reactionary and parsing them.




Timber is different approach to logging. It's all encompassing logging solution built specifically for applications. It
turns your application logs into rich structured events and provides a beautiful and fast
console

no complicated interfaces, no brittle parsing rules, just simple straight forward logging
that saves you time and makes you more productive.

Timber is an all encompassing logging solution that makes logs useful. Logs
that save you time and make you more productive, not the other way around.


Timber is an all encompassing approach to logging: from the data being logged to the application
used to access your logs.

Timber was created out of frustration. Logging is awfully antiquated and not well suites for
modern distributes parallelized applications.

timber believes the usefulness of logging starts with the data being logged, not parsing.

and provide a design designed to maximize productivity with this data structure.

Accessing our application logs used to make us cringe. It was a time consuming, frustrating,
and often fruitless process. If you were like us, it went something like this:

> I need to access my logs; I should centralize them. Where should I send them?
> Which provider should I use? Why is this so expensive? Wow, my logs are a mess.
> Why can't I search based on attributes? Would structuring my logs help?
> Which format should I use? Will they still be human readable?
> What if the structure changes? What about logs from 3rd party libraries? Ahhh!!!

Timber answers all of these questions by providing a complete, managed, end-to-end logging solution
that marries a [beautiful, *fast*, console](https://timber.io) with libraries that automatically
structure and enrich your logs. Timber doesn't just parse your logs and make the best of it, it
improves the entire logging process, all the way to the messages logged.


## How it works

The Timber ruby library takes care of all of the log structuring madness. For example,
it turns this Rails log line:

```
Completed 200 OK in 117ms (Views: 85.2ms | ActiveRecord: 25.3ms)
```

Into this:

```javascript
{
  "dt": "2016-12-01T02:23:12.236543Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Completed 200 OK in 117ms (Views: 85.2ms | ActiveRecord: 25.3ms)",
  "context": {
    "http": {
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/checkout",
      "remote_addr": "123.456.789.10",
      "request_id": "abcd1234"
    },
    "user": {  // <---- http://i.giphy.com/EldfH1VJdbrwY.gif
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Ben Johnson",
      "email": "ben@johnson.com"
    }
  },
  "event": {
    "http_response": {
      "status": 200,
      "time_ms": 117
    }
  }
}
```

Notice we preserve the original log message. When viewing this event in the
[Timber Console](https://timber.io), you'll see the simple, human readable line with the
ability to view, and use, the attached structured data! Also, notice how rich the event is.
Beecause we're inside your application, we can capture data beyond what's in the log line.

(for a full list see [`Timber::Events`](lib/timber/events))


## Why Timber?

Glad you asked! :)

1. Human readable logs *and* rich structured data. You don't have to choose.
2. Data beyond what's in the log line itself making your logs exceptionally useful.
3. Normalized log data. Timber enforces a strict schema, meaning your log data, across all apps
   and languages will be normalized.
4. Absolutely no lock-in or risk of code debt. No fancy API, no proprietary data format locked
   away in our servers, Timber is just good ol' loggin'.
5. Fully managed, all the way from the log messages to the console you use. No fragile parsing
   rules or complicated interfaces.


## Logging Custom Events

> Another service? More lock-in? :*(

Nope! Logging custom events is Just Loggingâ„¢. Check it out:

```ruby
# Simple string (original Logger interface remains untouched)
Logger.warn "Payment rejected for customer abcd1234, reason: Card expired"

# Structured hash
Logger.warn message: "Payment rejected", type: :payment_rejected,
  data: {customer_id: "abcd1234", amount: 100, reason: "Card expired"}

# Using a Struct
PaymentRejectedEvent = Struct.new(:customer_id, :amount, :reason) do
  def message; "Payment rejected for #{customer_id}"; end
  def type; :payment_rejected; end
end
Logger.warn PaymentRejectedEvent.new("abcd1234", 100, "Card expired")
```

(for more examples, see [the `Timber::Logger` docs](lib/timber/logger.rb))

No mention of Timber anywhere!


## The Timber Console / Pricing

> What good is structured log data if you can't search and visualize it?

The [Timber Console](https://timber.io) is *fast*, modern, and beautiful console designed
specifically for this library.

A few example queries:

  1. `context.user.email:ben@johnson.com` - Tail a specific user!
  2. `context.http.request_id:1234` - View *all* logs for a given HTTP request!
  3. `event.http_reponse.time_ms>3000` - Easily find outliers and have the proper context to resolve them!
  4. `level:warn` - Log levels in your logs. Imagine that!

> This is all gravy, but wouldn't the extra data get expensive?

If you opt to use the [Timber Console](https://timber.io), we only charge for
the size of the `message`, `dt`, and `event.custom` attributes. Everything else is
stored at no cost to you. [Say wha?!](http://i.giphy.com/l0HlL2vlfpWI0meJi.gif). This ensures
pricing remains predictable. We charge per GB sent to us and retained. No user limits,
no weird feature matrixes, just data. Finally, the data is yours, in a simple
non-proprietary JSON format that you can export to S3, Redshift, or any of our other integrations.

For more details checkout out [timber.io](https://timber.io).

## Install

**Timber is in beta testing. If interested, please email beta@timber.io**

### 1. Install the gem:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'timber'
```

### 2. Install the logger:

#### Heroku:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb (or staging, etc)
config.logger = Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT)
```

The command to add your log drain will be displayed in the [Timber app](https://app.timber.io)
after you add your application.

#### Non-Heroku:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb (or staging, etc)
log_device = Timber::LogDevices::HTTP.new(ENV['TIMBER_KEY']) # key can be obtained by signing up at https://timber.io
config.logger = Timber::Logger.new(log_device)
```

Your Timber application key will be displayed in the [Timber app](https://app.timber.io)
after you add your application.


*Other transport methods coming soon!*


#### Rails TaggedLogging?

No probs! Use it as normal, Timber will even pull out the tags and include them in the `context`.

```ruby
config.logger = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT))
```
