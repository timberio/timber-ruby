Timber is a complete, fully-managed, *structured* logging system that you can setup in
minutes. It pairs libraries that automatically structure your logs (like this one),
with a [beautiful modern console](https://timber.io) designed specifically for this data.

To learn more, checkout out [timber.io](https://timber.io) or the
["why we built Timber"](http://moss-ibex2.cloudvent.net/blog/why-were-building-timber/)
blog post.


## Overview

<details><summary><strong>What does Timber do?</strong></summary><p>

To extend the above description, Timber...

1. Automatically structures your framework and 3rd party logs (see next question).
2. Provides a [framework for logging custom events](#what-about-custom-events).
3. Does not lock you in with a special API or closed data. Just better logging.
4. Defines a [normalized log schema](https://github.com/timberio/log-event-json-schema) across *all* of your apps. Implemented by [our libraries](https://github.com/timberio).
5. Offers a [beautiful modern console](https://timber.io) designed specifically for this data. Pre-configured and tuned out of the box.
6. Gives you *6 months of retention*, by default.
7. Does not charge you for the extra structured data we're encouraging here, only the core log message.
8. Encrypts your data in transit and at rest.
9. Offers 11 9s of durability.
10. ...and so much more!

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>What events does Timber capture & structure for me?</strong></summary><p>

Out of the box you get everything in the [`Timber::Events`](lib/timber/events) namespace:

1. [Controller Call Event](lib/timber/events/controller_call.rb)
2. [Exception Event](lib/timber/events/exception.rb)
3. [HTTP Client Request Event (net/http outgoing)](lib/timber/events/http_client_request.rb)
4. [HTTP Client Response Event (resposne from net/http outgoing)](lib/timber/events/http_client_response.rb)
5. [HTTP Server Request Event (incoming client request)](lib/timber/events/http_server_request.rb)
6. [HTTP Server Response Event (response to incoming client request)](lib/timber/events/http_server_response.rb)
7. [SQL Query Event](lib/timber/events/sql_query.ex)
8. [Template Render Event](lib/timber/events/template_render.rb)
9. ...more coming soon, [file an issue](https://github.com/timberio/timber-ruby/issues) to request.

We also add context to every log, everything in the [`Timber::Contexts`](lib/timber/contexts)
namespace. Context is structured data representing the current environment when the log line was
written. It is included in every log line. Think of it like join data for your logs:

1. [HTTP Context](lib/timber/contexts/http.rb)
2. [Organization Context](lib/timber/contexts/organization.rb)
3. [Process Context](lib/timber/contexts/process.rb)
4. [Server Context](lib/timber/contexts/server.rb)
5. [Runtime Context](lib/timber/contexts/runtime.rb)
5. [User Context](lib/timber/contexts/user.rb)
6. ...more coming soon, [file an issue](https://github.com/timberio/timber-ruby/issues) to request.

## Usage

<details><summary><strong>Basic logging</strong></summary><p>

No client, no special API, just use `Logger` as normal:

```elixir
logger.info("My log message")
```

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Custom events</strong></summary><p>

1. Log a Hash (simplest)

  ```ruby
  Logger.warn message: "Payment rejected", type: :payment_rejected,
  data: {customer_id: "abcd1234", amount: 100, reason: "Card expired"}
  ```

2. Log a Struct (recommended)

  Defining structs for your important events just feels oh so good :) It creates a strong contract
  with down stream consumers and gives you compile time guarantees.

  ```ruby
  PaymentRejectedEvent = Struct.new(:customer_id, :amount, :reason) do
    def message; "Payment rejected for #{customer_id}"; end
    def type; :payment_rejected; end
  end
  Logger.warn PaymentRejectedEvent.new("abcd1234", 100, "Card expired")
  ```

* For more advanced examples see [`Timber::Logger`](lib/timber.logger.rb).
* Also, notice there are no special APIs, no risk of code-debt, and no lock-in. It's just better
  logging.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Custom contexts</strong></summary><p>

Context is structured data representing the current environment when the log line was written.
It is included in every log line. Think of it like join data for your logs. For example, the
`http.request_id` field is included in the context, allowing you to find all log lines related
to that request ID, if desired. This is in contrast to *only* showing log lines that have this
value contained.

1. Add a Hash (simplest)

  ```ruby
  Timber::CurrentContext.with({type: :build, data: {version: "1.0.0"}}) do
    logger.info("This message will include the wrapped context")
  end
  ```

  This adds data to the context keyspaced by `build`.

2. Add a Struct (recommended)

  Just like events, we recommend defining your custom contexts. It makes a stronger contract
  with downstream consumers.

  ```ruby
  BuildContext = Struct.new(:version) do
    def type; :build; end
  end
  build_context = BuildContext.new("1.0.0")
  Timber::CurrentContext.with(build_context) do
    logger.info("This message will include the wrapped context")
  end
  ```

</p></details>


## Installation

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'timber'
```


## Setup

<details><summary><strong>Rails >= 3.0</strong></summary><p>

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb (or staging, etc)

config.logger = Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT)
```

Are you using Rails tagged logging? If so, use this instead:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb (or staging, etc)

config.logger = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT))
```

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Other</strong></summary><p>

1. *Insert* the Timber probes:

  This should be executed *immediately after* you have required your dependencies.

  ```ruby
  Timber::Probes.insert!
  ```

2. *Add* the Rack middlewares:

  This should be included where you build your `Rack` application. Usually `config.ru`:

  ```ruby
  # Most likely config.ru

  Timber::RackMiddlewares.middlewares.each do |m|
    use m
  end
  ```

2. *Instantiate* the Timber logger:

  This should be *globally* available to your application:

  ```ruby
  logger = Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT)
  ```

</p></details>


## Send your logs

<details><summary><strong>Heroku (log drains)</strong></summary><p>

The recommended strategy for Heroku is to setup a
[log drain](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains)<sup>1</sup>. To get your Timber log drain URL:

**--> [Add your app to Timber](https://app.timber.io)**

1. For high volume apps Heroku log drains will drop messages. This is true for any Heroku app,
   in which case we recommend the Network method below.*

---

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>All other platforms (Network / HTTP)</strong></summary><p>

1. *Use* the Timber Network logger backend in `config/environments/production.rb`:

  ```ruby
  # config/environments/production.rb (or staging, etc)
  network_log_device = Timber::LogDevices::Network.new(ENV['TIMBER_LOGS_KEY'])
  config.logger = Timber::Logger.new(network_log_device) # <-- Use network_log_device instead of STDOUT
  ```

2. Obtain your Timber API :key: by **[adding your app in Timber](https://app.timber.io)**.
   Afterwards simply assign it to the `TIMBER_LOGS_KEY` environment variable.
