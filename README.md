## Overview

Timber solves structured logging so you don't have to. Go from raw text logs to rich
structured events with a single command. Spend more time focusing on your app and less time
focusing on logging.

1. **Easy setup.** - `bundle exec timber install`, get setup in seconds.

2. **Automatically structures yours logs.** - Third-party and in-app logs are all structured
   in a consistent format. See [how it works](#how-it-works) below.

3. **Seamlessly integrates with popular libraries and frameworks.** - Rails, Rack, Devise,
   Omniauth, etc. Automatically captures user context, HTTP context, and event data.


## Installation

1. In `Gemfile`, add the `timber` gem:

    ```ruby
    gem 'timber', '~> 2.0'
    ```

2. In your `shell`, run `bundle install`

3. In your `shell`, run `bundle exec timber install`


## How it works

Let's start with an example. Timber turns this familiar raw text log line:

```
Sent 200 in 45.2ms
```

Into a rich [`http_server_response` event](https://timber.io/docs/ruby/events-and-context/http-server-response-event/).

```
Sent 200 in 45.2ms @metadata {"dt": "2017-02-02T01:33:21.154345Z", "level": "info", "context": {"user": {"id": 1, "name": "Ben Johnson"}, "http": {"method": "GET", "host": "timber.io", "path": "/path", "request_id": "abcd1234"}, "system": {"hostname": "1.server.com", "pid": "254354"}}, "event": {"http_server_response": {"status": 200, "time_ms": 45.2}}}
```

Notice that instead of completely replacing your log messages,
Timber _augments_ your logs with critical metadata. Turning them into
[rich events with context](https://timber.io/docs/ruby/events-and-context) without sacrificing
readability.

This is all accomplished by using the
[Timber::Logger](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/timberio/timber-ruby/Timber/Logger):

```
logger = Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT)
logger.info("Send 200 in 45.2ms")
```

Here's a better look at the metadata:

```json
{
  "dt": "2017-02-02T01:33:21.154345Z",
  "level": "info",
  "context": {
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Ben Johnson"
    },
    "http": {
      "method": "GET",
      "host": "timber.io",
      "path": "/path",
      "request_id": "abcd1234"
    },
    "system": {
      "hostname": "1.server.com",
      "pid": "254354"
    }
  },
  "event": {
    "http_server_response": {
      "status": 200,
      "time_ms": 45.2
    }
  }
}
```

This structure isn't arbitrary either, it follows the
[log event JSON schema](https://github.com/timberio/log-event-json-schema), which formalizes the
structre, creates a contract with downstream consumers, and improves stability.

So what can you do with this data? Amazing things:

1. **Tail a user** - `user.id:1`
2. **Trace a request** - `http.request_id:abcd1234`
3. **Narrow by host** - `system.hostname:1.server.com`
4. **View slow responses** - `http_server_response.time_ms:>=1000`
5. **Filter by log level** - `level:info`

For a complete overview, see the [Timber for Ruby docs](https://timber.io/docs/ruby/overview/).


## Usage

<details><summary><strong>Basic logging</strong></summary><p>

Use the `Timber::Logger` just like you would `::Logger`:

```ruby
logger = Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT)
logger.info("My log message") # use warn, error, debug, etc.

# => My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}
```

---

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Custom events</strong></summary><p>

Custom events allow you to extend beyond events already defined in
the [`Timber::Events`](lib/timber/events) namespace.

```ruby
logger = Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT)
logger.warn "Payment rejected", payment_rejected: {customer_id: "abcd1234", amount: 100, reason: "Card expired"}

# => Payment rejected @metadata {"level": "warn", "event": {"payment_rejected": {"customer_id": "abcd1234", "amount": 100, "reason": "Card expired"}}, "context": {...}}
```

* Notice the `:payment_rejected` root key. Timber will classify this event as such.
* In the [Timber console](https://app.timber.io) use the query: `type:payment_rejected` or `payment_rejected.amount:>100`.
* See more details on our [custom events docs page](https://timber.io/docs/ruby/custom-events/)

---

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Custom contexts</strong></summary><p>

Context is additional data shared across log lines. Think of it like log join data.
This is how a query like `context.user.id:1` can show you all logs generated by that user.
Custom contexts allow you to extend beyond contexts already defined in
the [`Timber::Contexts`](lib/timber/contexts) namespace.

```ruby
logger = Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT)
logger.with_context(build: {version: "1.0.0"}) do
  logger.info("My log message")
end

# => My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {"build": {"version": "1.0.0"}}}
```

* Notice the `:build` root key. Timber will classify this context as such.
* In the [Timber console](https://app.timber.io) use queries like: `build.version:1.0.0`
* See more details on our [custom contexts docs page](https://timber.io/docs/ruby/custom-contexts/)

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Metrics & Timings</strong></summary><p>

Aggregates destroy details, and with Timber capturing metrics and timings is just logging events.
Timber is built on modern big-data principles, it can calculate aggregates across terrabytes of
data in seconds. Don't reduce the quality of your data because the system processing
your data is limited.

Here's a timing example. Notice how Timber automatically calculates the time and adds the timing
to the message.

```ruby
logger = Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT)
timer = Timber::Timer.start
# ... code to time ...
logger.info("Processed background job", background_job: {time_ms: timer})

# => Processed background job in 54.2ms @metadata {"level": "info", "event": {"background_job": {"time_ms": 54.2}}}
```

Or capture any metric you want:

```ruby
logger = Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT)
logger.info("Credit card charged", credit_card_charge: {amount: 123.23})

# => Credit card charged @metadata {"level": "info", "event": {"credit_card_charge": {"amount": 123.23}}}
```

In Timber you can easily sum, average, min, and max the `amount` attribute across any interval
you desire.

## Configuration

Most aspects of Timber are configurable, but Timber is also designed in a modular way, allowing
you to easily extend it if necessary. See
[Timber::Config](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/timberio/timber-ruby/Timber/Config) for a
comprehensive list. Here are a few popular options:

<details><summary><strong>Change log formats</strong></summary><p>

Simply set the formatter like you would with any other logger:

```ruby
logger = Timber::Logger.new(STDOUT)
logger.formatter = Timber::Logger::JSONFormatter.new
```

Your options are:

1. [`Timber::Logger::AugmentedFormatter`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/timberio/timber-ruby/Timber/Logger/AugmentedFormatter) -
   (default) A human readable format with metadata _appended_ to the original log line.
   Ex: `My log message @metadata {"level":"info","dt":"2017-01-01T01:02:23.234321Z"}`

2. [`Timber::Logger::JSONFormatter`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/timberio/timber-ruby/Timber/Logger/JSONFormatter) -
   Ex: `{"level":"info","message":"My log message","dt":"2017-01-01T01:02:23.234321Z"}`

3. [`Timber::Logger::LogfmtFormatter`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/timberio/timber-ruby/Timber/Logger/LogfmtFormatter) -
   A simple key/value format. `level=info message="My log message" dt=2017-01-01T01:02:23.234321Z`

3. [`Timber::Logger::MessageOnlyFormatter`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/timberio/timber-ruby/Timber/Logger/MessageOnlyFormatter) -
   For use in development / test. Prints logs as strings with no metadata attached.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Capture custom user context</strong></summary><p>

By default Timber automatically captures user context for mot of the popular authentication
libraries (Devise, Omniauth, and Clearance). See
[Timber::Integrations::Rack::UserContext]()
for a complete list.

In cases where you Timber doesn't support your strategy, or you want to customize it further,
you can do so like:

```ruby
# config/initializers/timber.rb
Timber::Integrations::Rack::UserContext.custom_user_hash = lambda do |rack_env|
  user = rack_env['warden'].user
  if user
    {
      id: user.id, # unique identifier for the user, can be an integer or string,
      name: user.name, # identifiable name for the user,
      email: user.email, # user's email address
    }
  else
    nil
  end
end
```

*All* of the keys are optional, but you must provide at least one.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Lograge-ify (configure Timber to act like lograge)</strong></summary><p>

Using [lograge](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge)? We've provided a convenience method that
configures Timber to behave in a similar way (but not exact):

```ruby
# config/initializers/timber.rb
Timber::Config.instance.logrageify!
```

This is equivalent to:

```ruby
# config/initializers/timber.rb
Timber::Integrations::ActionController.silence = true
Timber::Integrations::ActionView.silence = true
Timber::Integrations::ActiveRecord.silence = true
Timber::Integrations::ActiveRecord.silence = true
```

The big difference is that Timber does *not* collapse the request and response lines into
a single log line.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Silence noisy logs (sql query, template renders, etc)</strong></summary><p>

You can disable Timber integrations entirely or simply silence them. Disabling is like
removing the code from Timber. The library will use it's defaults. Silencing ensures that library
does not log at all. This is partly how we accomplish the logrageify option above.

```ruby
# config/initializers/timber.rb

# Don't log any ActionViews template renders
Timber::Integrations::ActionView.silence = true

# Don't log any ActiveRecord SQL queries, period
Timber::Integrations::ActiveRecord.silence = true

# Don't touch ActionController, use the default log messages (don't structure them)
Timber::Integrations::ActionController.enabled = false
```

</p></details>


## Jibber-Jabber

<details><summary><strong>Which events and context does Timber capture for me?</strong></summary><p>

Out of the box you get everything in the [`Timber::Events`](lib/timber/events) namespace.

We also add context to every log, everything in the [`Timber::Contexts`](lib/timber/contexts)
namespace. Context is structured data representing the current environment when the log line
was written. It is included in every log line. Think of it like join data for your logs. It's
how Timber is able to accomplished tailing users (`context.user.id:1`).

---

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>What about my current log statements?</strong></summary><p>

They'll continue to work as expected. Timber adheres to the default `::Logger` interface.
Your previous logger calls will work as they always do. Just swap in `Timber::Logger` and
you're good to go.

In fact, traditional log statements for non-meaningful events, debug statements, etc, are
encouraged. In cases where the data is meaningful, consider [logging a custom event](#usage).

</p></details>


<details><summary><strong>?</strong></summary><p>

1. **It's just _better_ logging**. Nothing beats well structured, open, raw data.
2. **Improved log data quality.** Instead of relying on parsing alone, Timber ships libraries that
   structure and augment your logs from _within_ your application. Improving your log data at the
   source.
3. **Human readability.** Timber _augments_ your logs without sacrificing human readability. For
   example: `log message @metadata {...}`. And when you view your logs in the
   [Timber console](https://app.timber.io), you'll see the human friendly messages
   with the ability to view the associated metadata.
4. **Long retention**. Logging is notoriously expensive with low retention. Timber
   offers _6 months_ of retention by default with sane prices.
5. **Normalized schema.** Have multiple apps? All of Timber's libraries adhere to our
   [JSON schema](https://github.com/timberio/log-event-json-schema). This means queries, alerts,
   and graphs for your ruby app can also be applied to your elixir app (for example).
