    # Custom contexts allow you to add application specific context not covered elsewhere.
    # Any data added this way will be included in your logs. A good example is worker job
    # IDs. When processing a job you might add the job ID to the context, allowing you to
    # view *all* logs generated while processing that job, not just the logs that contain
    # the ID.
    #
    # Note in the example below all custom contexts must contain a root key. This is to
    # ensure attribute names and types never clash across your contexts. It gives you
    # much cleaner pallete to organize your data on.
    #
    # @example Adding a custom context
    #   logger.with_context(build: {version: "1.0.0"}) do
    #     # anything logged here will have the custom context above
    #     # when this block exits the context will no longer be included
    #   end
