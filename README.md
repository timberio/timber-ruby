## Overview

Timber improves your logs so you can solve issues faster. There are no agents, special APIs, or
locked away data; just better logging.

Timber works by automatically by turning your raw text logs into rich structured events. It
pairs with the [Timber Console](https://app.timber.io) to maximize your productivity, allowing
you to _quickly_ find what you need so that you get back to doing what you do.
With Timber you'll _always_ have the data you need to resolve issues.

To provide an example, Timber turns this:

```
Sent 200 in 45.ms
```

Into this:

```
Sent 200 in 45.2ms @metadata {"dt": "2017-02-02T01:33:21.154345Z", "level": "info", "context": {"user": {"id": 1}, "http": {"method": "GET", "host": "timber.io", "path": "/path", "request_id": "abcd1234"}}, "event": {"http_response": {"status": 200, "time_ms": 45.2}}}
```

Allowing you to run queries like:

1. `context.request_id:abcd1234` - View all logs generated for a specific request.
2. `context.user.id:1` - View logs generated by a specific user.
3. `type:exception` - View all exceptions with the ability to zoom out and view them in context (request, user, etc).
4. `http_server_response.time_ms:>=1000` - View slow responses with the ability to zoom out and view them in context (request, user, etc).
5. `level:error` - Levels in your logs, imagine that!


## Installation

1. In `Gemfile`, add the `timber` gem:

    ```ruby
    # Gemfile

    gem 'timber'
    ```

2. In your `shell`, run `bundle exec timber install`


## Usage

<details><summary><strong>Basic logging</strong></summary><p>

Use `Logger` as normal:

```ruby
logger.info("My log message")

# My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}
```

Timber will *never* deviate from the public `::Logger` interface in *any* way.

<details><summary><strong>Tagging logs</strong></summary><p>

Tags provide a quick way to categorize logs and make them easier to search:

```ruby
logger.info("My log message", tag: "tag")

# My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "tags": ["tag"], "context": {...}}
```

Multiple tags:

```ruby
logger.info("My log message", tags: ["tag1", "tag2"])

# My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"], "context": {...}}
```

Using `ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging`? It works with that as well:

```ruby
logger.tagged("tag") do
  logger.info("My log message", tags: ["important", "slow"])
end

# My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "tags": ["tag"], "context": {...}}
```

* In the Timber console use the query: `tags:tag`.

---

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Timing events</strong></summary><p>

Timings provid a simple way to time code execution:

```ruby
start = Time.now
# ...my code to time...
time_ms = (Time.now - start) * 1000
logger.info("Task complete", tag: "my_task", time_ms: time_ms)

# My log message @metadata {"level": "info", tags: ["my_task"], "time_ms": 54.2132, "context": {...}}
```

* In the Timber console use the query: `tags:my_task time_ms>500`
* The Timber console will also display this value inline with your logs. No need to include it
  in the log message, but you certainly can if you'd prefer.

<details><summary><strong>Custom events</strong></summary><p>

Custom events can be used to structure information about events that are central
to your line of business like receiving credit card payments, saving a draft of a post,
or changing a user's password. You have 2 options to do this:

1. Log a structured Hash

    ```ruby
    Logger.warn "Payment rejected", payment_rejected: {customer_id: "abcd1234", amount: 100, reason: "Card expired"}

    # Payment rejected @metadata {"level": "warn", "event": {"payment_rejected": {"customer_id": "abcd1234", "amount": 100, "reason": "Card expired"}}, "context": {...}}
    ```

2. Or, log a Struct

    Defining structs for your important events just feels oh so good :) It creates a strong contract
    with down stream consumers and gives you compile time guarantees.

    ```ruby
    PaymentRejectedEvent = Struct.new(:customer_id, :amount, :reason) do
      def message; "Payment rejected for #{customer_id}"; end
      def type; :payment_rejected; end
    end
    Logger.warn PaymentRejectedEvent.new("abcd1234", 100, "Card expired")

    # Payment rejected @metadata {"level": "warn", "event": {"payment_rejected": {"customer_id": "abcd1234", "amount": 100, "reason": "Card expired"}}, "context": {...}}
    ```

* In the Timber console use queries like: `payment_rejected.customer_id:xiaus1934` or `payment_rejected.amount>100`

#### What about regular Hashes, JSON, or logfmt?

Go for it!

```ruby
logger.info({key: "value"})
# {"key": "value"} @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}

logger.info('{"key": "value"}')
# {"key": "value"} @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}

logger.info('key=value')
# key=value @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}
```

<details><summary><strong>Custom contexts</strong></summary><p>

Context is additional data shared across log lines. Think of it like log join data.

1. Add a Hash

    ```ruby
    Timber::CurrentContext.with({build: {version: "1.0.0"}}) do
      logger.info("My log message")
    end

    # My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {"build": {"version": "1.0.0"}}}
    ```

2. Or, add a Struct

    ```ruby
    BuildContext = Struct.new(:version) do
      def type; :build; end
    end
    build_context = BuildContext.new("1.0.0")
    Timber::CurrentContext.with(build_context) do
      logger.info("My log message")
    end

    # My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {"build": {"version": "1.0.0"}}}
    ```

</p></details>


## Jibber-Jabber

<details><summary><strong>Which log events does Timber structure for me?</strong></summary><p>

Out of the box you get everything in the [`Timber::Events`](lib/timber/events) namespace.

We also add context to every log, everything in the [`Timber::Contexts`](lib/timber/contexts)
namespace. Context is structured data representing the current environment when the log line
was written. It is included in every log line. Think of it like join data for your logs.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>What about my current log statements?</strong></summary><p>

They'll continue to work as expected. Timber adheres to the default `Logger` interface.
Your previous logger calls will work as they always do.

In fact, traditional log statements for non-meaningful events, debug statements, etc, are
encouraged. In cases where the data is meaningful, consider [logging a custom event](#usage).

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>How is Timber different?</strong></summary><p>

1. **No lock-in**. Timber is just _better_ logging. There are no agents or special APIs. This means
   no risk of vendor lock-in, code debt, or performance issues.
2. **Data quality.** Instead of relying on parsing alone, Timber ships libraries that structure
   and augment your logs from _within_ your application. Improving your log data at the source.
3. **Human readability.** Structuring your logs doesn't have to mean losing readability. Instead,
   Timber _augments_ your logs. For example: `log message @metadata {...}`. And when you view
   your logs in the [Timber console](https://app.timber.io), you'll see the human friendly messages
   with the ability to view the associated metadata.
4. **Sane prices, long retention**. Logging is notoriously expensive with low retention. Timber
   is affordable and offers _6 months_ of retention by default.
5. **Normalized schema.** Have multiple apps? All of Timber's libraries adhere to our
   [JSON schema](https://github.com/timberio/log-event-json-schema). This means queries, alerts,
   and graphs for your ruby app can also be applied to your elixir app (for example).
