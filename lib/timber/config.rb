  # environment variable. If that is not set, a reasonable default will be chosen. Each
  # method documents this.

    # This method allows the delegation of the logger method to a given block. This has

    #
    # 1. It allows us to delegate the logger call to methods like `::Rails.logger`. In
    #    a rails environment, this is generally the main logger and Timber respects it.
    # 2. It allows Timber to call `Config.instance.logger` internally without having to
    #    worry about the environment. This way each framework can be responsible for setup.
